## Getting to know the interface

Before you build the first page of Bloc Jams, you should understand how to navigate the workspace. While it's pretty simple to use, let's walk through each portion of the page.

The project workspace is broken down into three segments:

* **Navigation**: preview, publish and change the device view
* **Display**: build your page, add elements, and see the results rendered
* **Panels**: add and customize elements on your page

Let's look at each segment in more detail.

### Navigation

* **Settings**: customize site settings, such as SEO (search engine optimization), custom domain names, fonts and analytics
* **Pages**: select from a list of pages you've created, make new pages and change the settings for pages
* **Preview**: quickly view a site to test formatting, interactions and layout
* **Publish**: deploy a site to a public URL
* **Export**: download a compressed (zip) directory of your files (HTML, CSS and images).
* **[View Sizes](http://tutorials.webflow.com/different-view-modes-inside-webflow)**: view portrait and landscape orientations for desktops, tablets and phones

### Display

Right now, all we have is a blank canvas, but this is where our pages will be rendered. Soon, our display will be full of beautifully styled HTML elements and images.

### Panels

> At any time, you can access these panels by tapping on the shortcut key, shown in the images associated with each panel.

The **Add** panel allows you to select different elements, such as layouts, links, buttons, lists, text blocks, images and more. We'll use this quite a bit in the upcoming chapters.

The **Style** panel allows you to quickly change the CSS properties of the selected element. For example, if you wanted to change the background color of the entire page, you would select the Body element and update the background preferences on this panel.

With most of the elements we'll be adding, you'll need to specify class names in order to style them properly. We'll walk through that process as we lay out and styling our pages.

The **Style** panel allows you to change the position of a selected element, update the typography, effects, shadows, and more. To apply margin and padding, simply change the numbers inside the position portion of the panel. If you've ever coded CSS from scratch, you'll already see how much easier this is in a design tool like Webflow.

The **Settings** panel allows you to add interactions to elements. We'll go through this in detail later, after we've added some basic elements to our page.

The **Navigator** panel defines the structure of your site. The structure is essential to making sure the pages are created as we expect. This panel creates a tree structure that you can use to move, shift and adjust the order of your elements as you lay them out your page.

The **Style Manager** panel allows you to view all of the styles you've created in one place. Right now, it's not a crowded room, but it will be soon.

The **Asset Manager** panel is where you can save symbols and elements you want to reuse.  You can reuse a button, icon, or even a logo, and you can manage those assets here.

OK, enough talking, let's build already! In the next chapter we'll design the home page.
