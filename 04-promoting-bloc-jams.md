## Promoting Bloc Jams

We should add more information to our page to explain why Bloc Jams is so great. Let's create a new section named "Promo" and make it look great:

<center>
<video width="1024" height="576" controls> <source src="https://bloc-books.s3.amazonaws.com/webflow/screencasts/BlocJams-8.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>

We now have an area dedicated to promoting our product. To recap, we:

* added a section named `promo`
* filled the section with a radial gradient
* added 30px of padding to the top and bottom of the section
* added a container
* added a `h3` element
* added a paragraph text element
* added an image to our container
* uploaded `blocjams.jpg` to our image element
* changed `h3` to be 42px font size and line height
* changed the heading and paragraph text to be open sans, light, and center aligned
* added 25px of margin to the bottom of the paragraph element

We've added a subtle radial gradient to our promo section to create a simple lighting effect. In this section, we've used an `h3` tag, since we've already used the `h1` and `h2` for our hero image. When building a website, it's good SEO (Search Engine Optimization) practice to start with the `h1` and move down the page. By adding spacing between your header, text block and image, it allows for each element to breath and makes it easier on the users' eyes as they are scanning the page.

Our promotion area is looking good, but we need a footer to complete the page. Let's do that next:

<center>
<video width="1024" height="576" controls> <source src="https://bloc-books.s3.amazonaws.com/webflow/screencasts/BlocJams-9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>

That wasn't too bad. We have a simple footer, but one that we can easily add to with more information in the future. To review our steps, we:

* added a section named `footer`
* added a container element
* added 20px of padding to the top and bottom of `footer`
* added a text block element named `footerText`
* changed the text block font properties to: open sans, white, 11px, center-aligned and uppercase

Our home page is in good shape. Let's move on to the browse page in the next chapter.
